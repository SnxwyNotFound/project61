        <p class="para">My favorite character is Donald Duck, because Donald's two dominant personality traits are his fiery temper and his upbeat attitude to life. Many Donald shorts start with Donald in a happy mood, without a care in the world until something comes along and spoils his day. His rage is a great cause of suffering in his life. On multiple occasions, it has caused him to get in over his head and lose competitions. There are times when he fights to keep his temper in check, and he sometimes succeeds in doing so temporarily, but he always returns to his normal angry self in the end. I also like Donald because he is funny, he gets mad at things which he doesn't need to get mad at. Like for example the video "Gone to peices", Goofy basically broke into peices and he kind of got a little scared for a moment. And in the "House painters" video, he got mad at the paint machine for painting his eyes and for not working properly. He is also AMAZING at building things. I love Donald so much, even when he is grumpy.</p>
