        <p>One day, Donald was so hungry, he went to check the fridge, but nothing was there! So he decided to go buy pizza and buy groceries later. So he went to buy pizza. *5 MINUTES LATER.* Donald arrived at the pizza store called "Cartoon Pizza" and he went into the store, it was more like a stand instead of a store but it was pretty big. He ordered an extra large cheese pizza. *15-20 MINUTES LATER.* The pizza was ready, the worker called Donald, and said that his pizza was ready to be picked up. So he went and picked the pizza up. Then he went back home, BUT when he saw the pizza, it was shaped like Mickey! So, he decided to call Mickey to invite him over! But Mickey didn't answer, so he got mad and kept spamming the call over and over, FINALLY Mickey picked up! Though he said "Hey Donald I'm busy making pizza right now, I currently can't talk right now. Bye!" Donald got SO mad that he broke a vase. He decided to go back to the store and said "HEY! PIZZA MAKER! You made it in a shape of my friend M-Mickey? Is that you?!" Mickey said "Yes, it is me Donald, I made it specially for you! Why don't I take a break and we go eat that pizza?" So of course Donald agreed and they ate the delicious pizza. *THE END*
